## Initial analysis

- The data for "disinformation" returned from the Crossref API is alot smaller
than the data returned by Crossref for "Fake News"

- As a result, only around 600 articles make up the "disinformation" dataset

- In addition, of those 600 articles, even less actually possess enough
citation data to constitute a network

- This is a critical shortcoming of this methodology. The ability to perform
network analyses is very dependent on the size and quality of Crossref API
data.
