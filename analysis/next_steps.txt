Next steps in conducting analysis:

1) More insight is needed on how the different communities cite each other.
        - What work is siloed? What work is interdisciplinary? This can 
        probably calculated in Python using network centrality algorithms.

2) How many articles are in each cluster? Is the topic dominated by a certain
discipline?
